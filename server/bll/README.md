The Business Logic layer - bll
=========================

This layer has the classes for containing all business logic related to system entities.
The bll is used primarily by the Controllers.

Each folder contains the bll and dal (Data Access Layer) objects as well as an index.js file to expose the BLL class.
The DAL classes are only accessed by their respective BLL class.
